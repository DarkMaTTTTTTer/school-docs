# 1763-1776 - The Problem of Empire

## How did the French-Indian War transform British rule in North America b/t 1763-1776?

### Big Ideas

* Following the F & I War, GB exerted more control over the NA colonies - the age of Salutary Neglect was over

### Effects of the French Indian War

* As British empire expanded following F-I War, the presence of the British govt in the colonies grew, taxes on colonists were raised
* War = debt = more taxes = growth of royal officials in colonies, tasked with collecting taxes
* War = New lands = increased conflict & British military presence&#x20;

### New Taxes

* 1763-Proclamation Act: limited where colonists could settle
* 1764-Sugar Act: Increased taxes on French sugar needed for rum
* 1765-Stamp Act: Tax placed on printed items (newspapers, wills, playing cards)
* 1765-Quartering Act: Colonial govt had to provide barracks & food for Brit soldiers
* England also introduced Vice-admiralty courts (British judges tried American colonists)

## How did colonists respond to changes in British rule in the 1760s & 1770s?

### Big Ideas

1. Colonists developed an “ideology of resistance,” which emphasized ideals such as liberty, equality, and self-government
2. Colonists began to organize, protest, and resist British rule

### An ideology of revolution

Colonial ideology of resistance emphasized their rights as “British subjects”

They drew their ideas from 3 sources:&#x20;

1. English Common Law (Magna Carta, Bill of Rights)
2. Enlightenment (John Locke, consent of the governed, natural rights)
3. English Whig Tradition (Glorious Revolution, social contract)

* Using the growing print culture, “Patriots” accused GB of tyranny & justified their resistance using political arguments
* They claimed:
*
  * They were not “colonists” but “British subjects,” w/ equal rights under British law&#x20;
  * There ought to be “NO taxation without representation”
* They had a right to be judged by a jury of their peers rather than crown officials
* Britain had no right to station troops amongst them during peacetime
* They had a right to settle in new lands

### Forms of resistance

Petitions

* Many colonial legislatures began to send petitions to Parliament (ex. Stamp Act Congress)

Mob Action

* mobs of colonists showed up to demand the resignation of tax collectors, often through violence or humiliation (ex. tar and feathering)

Non-Importation & Boycotts

* When specific goods were taxed, colonists stopped buying those goods (led to  smuggling, non-importation agreements)
* Women crucial as they are the “shoppers” of the family

### Resistance groups

* Sons of Liberty: colonial group of merchants/artisans who protested taxation laws in the 1760s, often used violence/force (Sam Adams)
* Committees of Correspondence: A communications network est in the colonies by colonial assemblies, spread word of British action & colonial resistance

## How did the British govt respond to colonial resistance?

### Big Ideas

1. Britain repealed certain taxes & replaced them w/ others
2. Britain sent more troops and reps of the British govt to the colonies to try to stop the colonial rebellion

### The Boston Massacre&#x20;

* 10% of Boston’s population is British redcoats, sent to enforce taxation laws
* Demonstrators threw items at British Redcoats at custom official’s house → shots were fired & 5 colonists die
* This event was used to rally sentiment against British rule → helped to recruit more Patriots

## What caused colonial resistance to develop into revolution?

### Boston Tea Party

* Tea Act was passed to bail British EIC → made British tea REALLY cheap, even w/ tax leftover from Townshend Act
* Colonists felt they were being bribed to pay taxes on tea
* Patriots (including Paul Revere) boarded British ships loaded w/ tea and dumped it into Boston Harbor

### Coercive Acts

* Britain’s response to the Boston Tea Party → Boston Harbor closed, hurt Patriot merchants
* Town meetings are closed
* More troops & quartering
* Trials are moved to Britain

## What caused resistance to turn into rebellion?

### First Continential Congress

* Colonists respond to Coercive Acts by forming the 1st Continental Congress - Continent-wide assembly which featured representatives from 13 colonies
* Demanded the repeal of the Coercive Acts & argued British gov’t had no right to legislate colonial life, only trade
* Together, they would continue to organize resistance
