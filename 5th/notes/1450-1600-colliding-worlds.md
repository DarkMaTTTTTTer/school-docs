# 1450-1600 - Colliding Worlds

## What was North America like pre-contact?

1. Native Americans groups were diverse
2. Native Americans developed diverse lifestyles as they adapted to and transformed their environments

* 60 Million native people in 1450, traveled to NA via the Bering Land Bridge
* Agricultural Revolution
  * The domestication of "three sister" crops (beans, squash, maize/corn) led to bigger, more advanced societies

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Incan Empire" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* Pueblo cultures (Anasazi, Hohokam, Mongollan)
  * Despite arid conditions, Maize, Ag based
  * Developed complex irrigation systems, pottery, adobe/cliff dwellings
* Mostly Hunter-gatherers
* Nomadic lifestyle, following the buffalo at first on food -> horse once Europeans introduce them
* Ex. Comanche
  * Expert raiders, stole horses & humans -> exchanged for European goods and food
* Hunter-gatherers, fishers
* Using canoes and long boats, they took advantages of the riches of ocean resources
* Rich resources -> leisure time -> advanced art & hierarchical social structures

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maize, potato, bean farmers, but also used natural resources (fish) | Confederacy of 6 nations, guided by sachems, matrilineal |
| Used birch bark canoes to travel the Great Lakes                    |                                                          |
| United by both tribal and clan identities, lived in longhouses      |                                                          |

* Mississippian Culture (Adena/Hopewell)
  * Maize, Ag production
  * ceremonial mound builders
  * large trading network at Cahokia
* Gender Roles
  * Men : warriors, hunters, fishers
  * Women: farmers, gatherers
  * Many societies were matrilineal
* Trade
  * Native Americans developed extensive regional trade routes
    * Ex. Navajo & Apaches traded buffalo hides for maize and pottery produced by the Pueblo
* Religion
  * Most Native Americans were animists, natural world full of spiritual power

## What was Europe like pre-contact?

1. Various political, economic, and religious shifts opened the door for exploration & the conquest of NA
2. European nations were motivated by GOD (spread religion), GLORY (for their nation-state) and Gold (wealth/riches)

Hierarchy & Authority

* Very patriarchal, hierarchical societies (most were peasants)
* Land/goods went to oldest son (primogeniture)
* Religion
* Crusades brought Europe in contact w/ ME, led to new learning, trade routes, goods
* Split b/t Catholicism & Protestantism following Reformation, religious wars common
* Religious rivalries motivated exploration/conquest/settlement



Shifts in European Life Political

* Nation-states developed & Kings centralized their power → desire to expand trade & territory grew Economic
* New trade routes desired
* Joint-stock companies formed, which could fund exploration & settlement Technological
* Advanced in maritime technology (ex. caravel ships), meant long-distance exploration was possible



## What patterns of interaction emerged as European exploration began?

1. Coastal Exploration of W Africa and discovery of America led to the rise of the Atlantic slave trade
2. Exploration of the “New World” - North, Central, South America led to the conquest and colonization of Native Peoples and lands

Exploration&#x20;

* Africa was home to over 100 million&#x20;
* &#x20;W African Kingdoms were rich in gold and controlled Trans-Saharan trade&#x20;
* To bypass this controlled inland trade route, Europeans wanted sea routes which would like them to Africa, India, and China
* Portugal and Spain were two of the first countries to explore widely
* Italy, Portugal and the Dutch continued to look for an alternate route to Asia and the Indies
* 1492: Columbus reaches the Bahamas
* NA/Euro contact established
* 1550: Human trafficking became profitable and Europeans began transporting African Slaves to the Americas

### Conquest

* 1521: Hernan Cortez had defeated the Aztec Empire
* 1535: Pizarro had defeated the Incan Empire
* The Great Death: Native American populations went from some 20 million to just 3 million
* Why? Guns (only Europeans had them), Germs (virgin-soil epidemics) and steel (only Europeans had it)
* The Columbian Exchange (named after Christopher Columbus) was about to begin

### Review and Respond

* Task 1: Draw a map of North America, label the various regions, and annotate your map with the names/descriptions of various NA groups who lived in those regions
* Task 2: Create an infographic (words and pictures) which communicates the factors which motivated and enabled European exploration of the New World
* Task 3: Read the primary source on the next slide and answer the accompanying question
