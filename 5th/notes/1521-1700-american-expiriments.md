# 1521-1700 - American Expiriments

## How did American-European contact change life on both sides of the Atlantic?

### Colombian Exchange

* European - American contact resulted in the Colombian Exchange
  * Eurasian flora/fauna (plants), domesticated animals, and germs introduced to the NW -> cash crops lead to slavery, animals change NA life, disease kills many

### Mercantilism

* The state regulates and protects industry & commerce -> end goal: produce a favorable balance of trade
* Colonies are the key to the nations power and prosperity because they supplies mother country with raw materials & increased demand for finished goods
  * Thriving trade = more taxes, duties for nation-states
* The economic shift from feudalism to mercantilism, encouraged Spain, Britain, France, Netherlands to expand colonization efforts in America

### New Spain

* New Spain was east in Mexico, spread to Southwest
* Economics: Farming, ranching, mining enriched landowners, the church and the crown

  * Crown grated land to immigrants -- who used land to grow cash crops/mine
  * landowners could claim "tribute" in labor from NAs -> later replaced with African slavery
* Society: 1500-1650: 300,000 Spaniards immigrate to MesoAmerica (2/3rd male) -> 300,000 Africans imported to labor on farms & mines
  * Racial mixing was very common, but elaborate caste system defined status/rights on basis of "race" (mulattos, mestizos, zambos)
* Religion: The Catholic Church est. churches/missions, seeking to convert and baptize native peoples
* Debate spread amongst Church/Spanish society regarding the humanity and reinstatement of NA
  * Ex. Bartolomeo de las Casas insisted NA were humans & Christians and shouldn't be treated as slaves
  * Ex. Juan Gines de Sepulveda argued NA were subhuman and enslavement was beneficial to them
* Native Resistance: Pueblo Na responded to Spanish dominance in NM with violent uprising, led to Spanish retreat from territory

### New France & New Netherlands

* France established "New France" in Modern Canada and down the Mississippi River
  * Small population, settlements conisisted of fur-trading posts
  * Emphasis on trade made for more peaceful relations with NA
  * NA-Euro intermarriage was common
