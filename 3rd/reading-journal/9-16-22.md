1. Identify Andrews's main point or thesis

{% hint style="danger" %}
The data that you produce allows companies like meta to make massive amounts of money off of you alone with targeted advertisements.
{% endhint %}

2\. Identify the sub points that make up her line of reasoning. This means not just listing her points but including some description of how they relate to one another. How does the first point lead to the next? Are two of the points both supporting a third, or is it more of a linear progression from one point to the next?

{% hint style="info" %}
One of her biggest sub points and the one that I stand with the most is the fact that data aggregators like myself can build a complete digital profile of you involving everything from your medical records to your habits, favorite color, who you like and what you are interested in. She ties this point as the whole basis of her article and how the theft of your own personal information allows for people to make millions off your one simple action of clicking a link. This then leads into how her position of how consumers do not know how much data is actually being taken from them. I would be more than happy to give a in-depth example involving student data collected by the school.
{% endhint %}

3\. Evaluate the evidence used to support the argument. In this case, I would like you to identify the specific piece of evidence you most compelling and the piece you found least compelling and explain why found each to be so.

{% hint style="info" %}
The most compelling the the amount of money that targeted advertising is making. I have seen these exact figures in my own eyes. The least compelling bit of informatin is how it potrays the bad actors as being too close to the people who are just trying to make a living legaly.
